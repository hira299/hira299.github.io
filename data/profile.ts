    "AI Engineer building production LLM pipelines, AI agents, and n8n automations, with hands-on QA and API testing for B2B SaaS platforms.",
  longBio: [
    "I'm an AI Engineer. I build production AI systems: multi-stage LLM enrichment pipelines, retrieval-augmented agents, and automations that connect models to real data, APIs, and databases.",
    "My engineering work spans Python, LangGraph, CRAG, pgvector, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, AWS, n8n, and Make.com. I built and maintained a production AI pipeline behind a 28,000+ record directory, with status-gated LLM stages, structured outputs, multilingual enrichment, and fault-tolerant parallel processing.",
    "I also test the systems I and others build. My QA work covers end-to-end journeys, API-level reproduction, authentication and authorization, multi-tenant isolation, business logic, financial reconciliation, and release verification, with 678+ defects identified and documented across QA engagements.",
